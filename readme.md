This is a Minecraft datapack for the Fabric versions of [End Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/endrem) and [Repurposed Structures](https://modrinth.com/mod/repurposed-structures-fabric). It makes the two mods compatible by making spawn the End Remastered eyes in all their respective repurposed structures.

I *think* the weight/spawn rates are accurate. If not, I'm open to pull requests!

I decided to not make the following eyes spawn:
- Nether Eye in Jungle Fortress (it's.. not a Nether structure)
- Cursed Eye in Underground Bastion (same reason)
- the Cold Eye can spawn in repurposed igloos, but I lowered the spawn rate
