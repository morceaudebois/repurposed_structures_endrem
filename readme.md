This is a Minecraft datapack for the Fabric versions of [End Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/endrem) and [Repurposed Structures](https://modrinth.com/mod/repurposed-structures-fabric). It makes the two mods compatible by making the End Remastered eyes spawn in all their respective repurposed structures.

## How to install

## Random stuff to know

I *think* the weight/spawn rates are accurate. They might need to be lowered for balance, as there will be more structures in the world. I'm open to pull requests if you think you can do it better!

I decided to not make the following eyes spawn:
- Nether Eye in Jungle Fortress (it's.. not a Nether structure)
- Cursed Eye in Underground Bastion (same reason)
- the Cold Eye can spawn in repurposed igloos, but I lowered the spawn rate

## Compatibility
As far as I understand, datapacks aren't compatible with each other. They don't simply add to the default loot tables, they completely override them. This means you'll probably run into issues if you have an other datapack installed that edits the same loot tables.
